# About

I have created an Machine Learning Webapp for Detection of Diseases!

It has three different disease data and three different models for each disease:

1) Diabetes

2) Heart Disease

3) Parkinson

I have used [Streamlit]() library for WEB UI and [Heroku]() for Deployment.

For more information related to code. Check Out the **[Notebook]()** and **[GUI]()** file.
